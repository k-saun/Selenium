Overview:
  Here is some code ive been playing around with recently with a suite of tools called
  Selenium! Selenium is a browser automation suite that is used for many purposes, but 
  primarily for automation testing. (In my case)

  Heres some code I've written while exploring concepts both in Ruby and Selenium. 
  Certain elements have been redacted in an effort to conserve privacy of the company/website
  I was accessing. The soul purpose of this repo is to provide some insight into what I've 
  been working on lately.

Use:
  $ruby SeleniumTestR.rb
